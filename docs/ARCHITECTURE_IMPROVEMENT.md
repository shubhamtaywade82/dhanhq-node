think like an architect of a trading system and review this dhanhq-node paper trading system for options trading in indices like NIFTY, sensex and banknifty we need to have both ce/pe buying and selling and agentic ai based options trading with trailing sl and tp, with all possible options trading strategies and backtesting enabled system which can work without any human intervention and the monitoring frontend should be realtime find flaws as an architect and also suggest solutions on how to handle such a system in a robust way where It can run paper trading on a laptop with real market data from dhanhq rest api and websockets connections handle all possible scenarios and not fail at any point even if it fails it should be able to recover reconcile and handle all error etc

# Architectural verdict

**The current `dhanhq-node` repository is a strong prototype/foundation, but it is not yet a fault-tolerant autonomous options trading platform.**

I would rate it approximately:

| Area                       |  Current |     Target |
| -------------------------- | -------: | ---------: |
| DhanHQ integration         |     8/10 |     9.5/10 |
| Market-data resilience     |   7.5/10 |     9.5/10 |
| Paper execution            |   6.5/10 |     9.5/10 |
| Multi-leg options modeling |     6/10 |     9.5/10 |
| Risk engine                |     7/10 |     9.5/10 |
| State/recovery             |     4/10 |     9.5/10 |
| Reconciliation             |     2/10 |      10/10 |
| Backtesting                |     5/10 |     9.5/10 |
| Agentic AI                 |     6/10 |       9/10 |
| Autonomous operation       |     6/10 |     9.5/10 |
| Realtime frontend          |     7/10 |       9/10 |
| Production trading safety  | **4/10** | **9.5/10** |

The important distinction is this:

> **You have built a sophisticated autonomous trading application. You have not yet built a trading system that is guaranteed to converge back to the correct state after failures.**

That second property is what matters most.

The current architecture already makes several good decisions: frontend-independent autonomy, one risk gate, paper/live engine separation, DhanHQ WS plus REST fallback, position monitoring, persistence abstraction, multi-leg strategy constructors, and explicit refusal to boot in live mode until the risk layer understands live positions.

But several critical design assumptions are still unsafe.

---

# 1. The biggest architectural flaw: no authoritative state machine

The system currently has state spread across:

* PostgreSQL
* an in-memory mirror
* `PositionMonitor`
* `EventBus`
* `AutonomyEngine`
* `RiskEngine`
* strategy records
* agent state
* DhanHQ itself

That is too many state holders.

The architecture document says PostgreSQL is the durable ledger and the in-memory state is a mirror.

But the actual system still has **multiple independently evolving states**.

For autonomous trading, the rule needs to be:

> **The trading ledger is authoritative. Everything else is derived state.**

You need this hierarchy:

```text
                 AUTHORITATIVE
                      │
              Trading Ledger
                      │
       ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
       ▼              ▼              ▼
   Positions       Orders        Strategies
       │              │              │
       └──────────────┼──────────────┘
                      ▼
               Derived State
                      │
        ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
        ▼             ▼             ▼
     Risk          Monitor       Frontend
        │
        ▼
      Agent
```

The agent must **never own truth**.

The frontend must **never own truth**.

The WS stream must **never own truth**.

The `PositionMonitor` must **never own truth**.

They all derive from the ledger.

---

# 2. You need an Order/Execution State Machine

This is the most important missing primitive.

A trading order cannot simply be:

```text
intent -> execute -> fill
```

It must be:

```text
CREATED
  ↓
VALIDATED
  ↓
RISK_APPROVED
  ↓
SUBMITTED
  ↓
ACKNOWLEDGED
  ↓
PARTIALLY_FILLED
  ↓
FILLED
```

with alternate paths:

```text
REJECTED
CANCEL_REQUESTED
CANCELLED
EXPIRED
UNKNOWN
FAILED
RECONCILING
```

For multi-leg orders, you additionally need:

```text
STRATEGY_ORDER
    │
    ├── LEG A
    ├── LEG B
    ├── LEG C
    └── LEG D
```

and strategy-level state such as:

```text
PLANNED
PRECHECKED
OPENING
PARTIALLY_OPEN
OPEN
ADJUSTING
PARTIALLY_CLOSED
CLOSING
CLOSED
FAILED
REPAIRING
```

Your current paper engine performs execution and then immediately writes resulting state.

That is fine for a deterministic simulator.

It is insufficient for an autonomous trading engine because the system must survive:

* process crash after DB write
* process crash before DB write
* duplicate order request
* duplicate websocket message
* delayed fill
* partial fill
* out-of-order order update
* stale order update
* reconnect
* retry after timeout
* simultaneous exit signals
* leg B failure after leg A succeeded

---

# 3. Multi-leg strategy execution is your next major weakness

Your repository already supports strategies such as:

* Iron Condor
* Iron Butterfly
* Bull Put Spread
* Bear Call Spread
* Bull Call Spread
* Bear Put Spread
* Long/Short Straddle
* Long/Short Strangle
* Ratio Spread
* ORB
* VWAP/RSI
* EMA
* naked option buying

The constructor is already explicitly BUY/SELL capable.

That is good.

But **constructing a four-leg strategy is not the same thing as executing a four-leg strategy safely.**

Example:

```text
BUY  25000 PE
BUY  25500 CE
SELL 24500 PE
SELL 26000 CE
```

Suppose:

```text
Leg 1 → filled
Leg 2 → filled
Leg 3 → rejected
Leg 4 → timeout
```

You now have:

```text
LONG 25000 PE
LONG 25500 CE
```

You do **not** have an Iron Condor.

The system must recognize:

```text
INTENDED_STRATEGY ≠ ACTUAL_STRATEGY
```

and automatically enter:

```text
REPAIRING
```

Then decide:

```text
complete missing legs
OR
flatten completed legs
OR
transform into a defined fallback structure
```

This must be deterministic.

**Never let an LLM decide emergency leg repair.**

---

# 4. Risk is currently too strategy-centric; it must become portfolio-centric

Your current RiskEngine is already significantly better than a typical prototype. It has:

* daily loss
* margin utilization
* consecutive losses
* rejection rate
* stale market data
* concurrent strategies
* portfolio delta
* kill switch

and the order paths funnel through `canTrade()`.

That is the correct concept.

But you need a much larger risk model.

## Required portfolio risk dimensions

### Directional

```text
Net Delta
Delta by underlying
Delta by expiry
Delta by strategy
```

### Convexity

```text
Gamma
Gamma concentration
Gamma near expiry
```

### Volatility

```text
Net Vega
Vega by expiry
IV percentile
IV skew
Term structure
```

### Time

```text
Theta
Days to expiry
Minutes to expiry
Expiry-day gamma risk
```

### Liquidity

```text
Bid/ask spread
Bid depth
Ask depth
Volume
OI
Impact estimate
```

### Concentration

```text
Max capital / strategy
Max capital / underlying
Max short premium
Max naked short exposure
Max same-expiry exposure
```

### Tail risk

```text
Scenario P&L
±0.5%
±1%
±2%
volatility shock
gap shock
IV crush
IV expansion
```

---

# 5. Your Greeks implementation is not production-grade

This is one of the more serious quantitative issues.

Your current `calculateGreeks()` is a standard Black-Scholes approximation and uses a fixed risk-free rate and IV inputs.

That is acceptable for approximate analytics.

It is **not sufficiently accurate for risk control**.

You currently have several approximations:

```text
risk-free rate = 6.5%
fallback IV = 15%
nearest expiry assumptions
simplified option-symbol parsing
simple Black-Scholes inputs
```

The portfolio-delta implementation also explicitly approximates using nearest expiry and flat 15% IV.

That should never be the primary breaker.

### Correct architecture

Use:

```text
Option Instrument Metadata
        ↓
Actual expiry
Actual strike
Actual spot
Actual IV
Actual contract multiplier
        ↓
Greeks Engine
        ↓
Portfolio Greeks
```

And for risk:

```text
Live quoted option
        ↓
IV inversion from market price
        ↓
Greeks
```

Then retain a fallback:

```text
market IV unavailable
        ↓
conservative proxy
        ↓
risk status = DEGRADED
```

not:

```text
approximation
        ↓
pretend precise
```

Your own code comments acknowledge that the current delta model is coarse.

---

# 6. The paper execution model is too optimistic

This is probably the biggest backtesting/trading-validity issue.

The paper engine currently:

```text
live LTP
+
fixed slippage ticks
+
fixed latency
=
fill
```

The implementation explicitly says market orders are filled using LTP with one fixed tick-size adjustment and marketable limits are treated as immediately fillable.

That is not a realistic order simulator.

There is no:

```text
bid
ask
bid size
ask size
queue position
market impact
spread widening
partial fill
gap
latency price movement
order-book depletion
rejection probability
freeze
auction
circuit condition
```

### Better paper engine

```text
                    MARKET DATA
                        │
              ┌─────────┴─────────┐
              ▼                   ▼
            LTP             Bid/Ask/Depth
              │                   │
              └─────────┬─────────┘
                        ▼
                  Execution Model
                        │
        ┌───────────────┼──────────────┐
        ▼               ▼              ▼
   Fill simulator  Partial fills   Rejections
        │
        ▼
      Ledger
```

At minimum:

### MARKET BUY

```text
price = ask
```

not:

```text
price = ltp + 0.05
```

### MARKET SELL

```text
price = bid
```

### LIMIT

It should rest until:

```text
bid/ask crosses limit
```

or:

```text
cancel
timeout
expiry
```

### Large order

If:

```text
quantity > available top-of-book depth
```

simulate partial execution.

# 7. Your "paper margin" fallback is dangerous for strategy validation

The current engine attempts to use the broker margin calculator, which is good, but falls back to a default resolver when unavailable.

For paper testing:

```text
margin API unavailable
       ↓
conservative fallback
```

is acceptable.

For **strategy ranking**, however, you must label the result:

```text
MARGIN_CONFIDENCE = LOW
```

Otherwise the strategy engine may compare two strategies whose capital requirements were calculated by different methodologies.

---

# 8. The biggest flaw in your backtesting system: it is not truly path-accurate yet

You already have a real historical options pipeline and specifically avoid synthetic data. That is excellent.

But your backtesting architecture is still too simplistic for the system you want.

The strategy universe currently evaluates things such as:

```text
SHORT_STRANGLE
SHORT_STRADDLE
IRON_CONDOR
IRON_BUTTERFLY
BULL_PUT_SPREAD
BEAR_CALL_SPREAD
BULL_CALL_SPREAD
BEAR_PUT_SPREAD
ORB
VWAP/RSI
LONG_STRADDLE
```

using target/SL/time-exit parameters.

That's a useful scorecard.

It is not enough for institutional-grade strategy validation.

You need **event-driven historical simulation**.

---

# 9. Backtest architecture should mirror live architecture

This is critical.

You currently effectively have:

```text
LIVE
DhanHQ WS
  ↓
MarketData
  ↓
Strategies
  ↓
Execution
  ↓
Risk
```

and:

```text
BACKTEST
historical data
  ↓
strategy evaluator
  ↓
metrics
```

That creates strategy drift.

Instead:

```text
             MARKET DATA INTERFACE
                      │
          ┌───────────┴───────────┐
          ▼                       ▼
    LiveDataSource          HistoricalDataSource
          │                       │
          └───────────┬───────────┘
                      ▼
                Market Event Bus
                      ▼
                Signal Engine
                      ▼
                Risk Engine
                      ▼
               Execution Model
                      ▼
                  Ledger
                      ▼
                 Metrics
```

Then:

```text
LIVE DATA ──────────────┐
                         ├── SAME STRATEGY CODE
HISTORICAL DATA ────────┘
```

That gives you:

> **backtest/live equivalence**

This is one of the most important architectural changes I would make.

---

# 10. You need walk-forward validation

Current validation is effectively:

```text
backtest
  ↓
win rate
profit factor
max DD
  ↓
pass
```

Your agent then uses that result as part of the execution gate. The code explicitly requires `passedValidation` before execution.

Good.

But a single backtest window is vulnerable to:

* overfitting
* parameter selection bias
* expiry-specific bias
* regime bias
* look-ahead contamination

Instead:

```text
Historical data
      │
      ▼
Train period
      │
      ▼
Validation period
      │
      ▼
Out-of-sample
      │
      ▼
Walk-forward
      │
      ▼
Monte Carlo
      │
      ▼
Stress testing
```

Required metrics:

```text
CAGR
Sharpe
Sortino
Calmar
Profit Factor
Expectancy
Max DD
Ulcer index
Win rate
Avg win
Avg loss
Payoff ratio
Tail loss
CVaR
Trade count
Turnover
Slippage sensitivity
Parameter sensitivity
```

---

# 11. Strategy definitions need to be data-driven, not hardcoded

Your strategy constructor currently has a growing union of strategy types.

This will eventually become a maintenance problem:

```typescript
type StrategyType =
  | ...
  | ...
  | ...
```

Instead use a strategy registry:

```text
StrategyRegistry
 ├── Directional
 ├── Volatility
 ├── Theta
 ├── Vertical
 ├── Calendar
 ├── Diagonal
 ├── Ratio
 ├── Butterfly
 ├── Condor
 ├── Synthetic
 └── Custom
```

Each strategy should declare:

```typescript
interface StrategyDefinition {
  id: string;
  family: StrategyFamily;

  signalEngine: SignalEngine;
  legBuilder: LegBuilder;
  riskModel: RiskModel;
  entryPolicy: EntryPolicy;
  exitPolicy: ExitPolicy;
  adjustmentPolicy?: AdjustmentPolicy;

  allowedUnderlyings: string[];
  allowedExpiries: ExpiryPolicy;
}
```

Then adding:

```text
Calendar Spread
Broken Wing Butterfly
Jade Lizard
Reverse Jade Lizard
Christmas Tree
Butterfly variants
Ratio Backspread
Covered structures
Synthetic positions
```

does not require restructuring your entire system.

---

# 12. "All possible options strategies" needs to be interpreted carefully

You should **not** build a giant hardcoded list and claim completeness.

Options strategy space is combinatorial.

Instead build a **Strategy DSL**.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Bullish defined-risk",
  "legs": [
    {
      "side": "BUY",
      "type": "CE",
      "delta": 0.55
    },
    {
      "side": "SELL",
      "type": "CE",
      "delta": 0.30
    }
  ],
  "expiry": "WEEKLY",
  "entry": {...},
  "exit": {...},
  "risk": {...}
}
```

Then strategies become compositions.

You can generate:

```text
1-leg
2-leg
3-leg
4-leg
N-leg
```

strategies without hardcoding each combination.

---

# 13. Agentic AI architecture needs to change fundamentally

Your current agent is:

```text
planner
 ↓
analyst
 ↓
strategy
 ↓
risk
 ↓
execution
 ↓
critic
```

This is conceptually good.

But I would **not allow an LLM to be the actual trading control loop**.

The correct hierarchy is:

```text
          DETERMINISTIC CORE
                │
      ┌─────────┴──────────┐
      ▼                    ▼
   Risk Engine         Execution Engine
      ▲                    ▲
      │                    │
      └──── Strategy Engine
               ▲
               │
         Agentic Layer
               ▲
          LLM reasoning
```

The LLM should produce:

```text
TradeProposal
```

not:

```text
PlaceOrder()
```

Example:

```json
{
  "underlying": "NIFTY",
  "expiry": "...",
  "strategy": "IRON_CONDOR",
  "legs": [...],
  "thesis": "...",
  "confidence": 0.82,
  "expectedRisk": 7300,
  "expectedReward": 11200
}
```

Then:

```text
Strategy Validator
        ↓
Risk Engine
        ↓
Execution Planner
        ↓
Order State Machine
```

The agent cannot bypass any of those.

---

# 14. Your current autonomous scanner can become a dangerous feedback loop

The AutonomyEngine periodically invokes the agent every 60 seconds when conditions permit.

That means:

```text
market
 ↓
agent
 ↓
trade
 ↓
market
 ↓
agent
 ↓
trade
...
```

There needs to be a **decision ledger**.

Every decision should be identified by:

```text
decision_id
market_snapshot_id
strategy_snapshot_id
agent_run_id
risk_snapshot_id
```

Then enforce:

```text
same opportunity
+
same state
+
same strategy
=
NO DUPLICATE TRADE
```

Otherwise the agent can repeatedly rediscover the same setup.

---

# 15. You need an Opportunity Engine separate from the Agent

I would split:

```text
Market Scanner
      ↓
Opportunity Detection
      ↓
Candidate Ranking
      ↓
Agent Analysis
      ↓
Risk Approval
      ↓
Execution
```

The LLM should **not scan every index from scratch every minute**.

Instead deterministic scanners generate:

```text
Opportunity {
  underlying,
  expiry,
  regime,
  direction,
  IV,
  liquidity,
  momentum,
  structure,
  timestamp
}
```

Then the LLM gets only candidate opportunities.

This dramatically reduces:

* LLM calls
* latency
* token usage
* hallucination surface
* duplicate reasoning
* unpredictable behaviour

---

# 16. Your self-healing system is the wrong kind of "self-healing"

This is subtle but important.

The current self-healing service watches recurring error messages and asks Ollama to generate an imperative rule, then injects that rule into agent prompts.

That's clever.

It is **not actual system self-healing**.

Example:

```text
WebSocket disconnects
 ↓
LLM writes:
"Reconnect aggressively"
```

That does not heal the system.

Real self-healing should be:

```text
failure detected
 ↓
classify failure
 ↓
choose deterministic remediation
 ↓
execute remediation
 ↓
verify recovery
 ↓
reconcile state
 ↓
resume
```

Use an explicit state machine:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
RECOVERING
RECONCILING
READY
FAILED_SAFE
```

For example:

```text
WS disconnected
 ↓
REST fallback
 ↓
retry WS
 ↓
WS connected
 ↓
resubscribe instruments
 ↓
replay missing market state
 ↓
verify heartbeat
 ↓
HEALTHY
```

The LLM may later analyze the incident.

It should **not control the primary recovery mechanism**.

---

# 17. EventBus must become durable

Your current EventBus is an in-process pub/sub spine.

That means:

```text
process dies
 ↓
events disappear
```

For trading systems, this is dangerous.

You need:

```text
COMMAND
EVENT
SNAPSHOT
```

with persistent event records.

At minimum:

```text
order_intents
order_events
fill_events
position_events
risk_events
strategy_events
system_events
reconciliation_events
```

with:

```text
event_id
aggregate_id
sequence_no
event_type
timestamp
payload
correlation_id
causation_id
```

Then you can recover by replaying state.

---

# 18. Idempotency is mandatory

Every trading command needs:

```text
idempotency_key
```

For example:

```text
strategy_id
+
signal_version
+
leg_id
+
action
```

So:

```text
order intent #ABC
```

submitted twice becomes:

```text
same order
```

rather than:

```text
two orders
```

This is absolutely critical when you have:

* agent retries
* network timeouts
* websocket reconnects
* HTTP retries
* process restarts

---

# 19. Reconciliation is almost completely missing

This is the biggest gap relative to your stated requirement.

You specifically want:

> "even if it fails it should be able to recover reconcile and handle all error"

The architecture currently has restart seeding for paper positions, which is good.

But that's not reconciliation.

You need:

```text
             RECONCILER
                 │
      ┌──────────┼──────────┐
      ▼          ▼          ▼
   orders     positions    funds
      │          │          │
      └──────────┼──────────┘
                 ▼
             DhanHQ
                 │
                 ▼
            local ledger
```

Every restart should execute:

```text
1. Load local ledger
2. Query broker/account state
3. Compare
4. Generate differences
5. Repair local state
6. Verify
7. Only then enable trading
```

For paper mode, broker state means:

```text
Dhan market state
+
paper ledger
```

For future live:

```text
Dhan order book
+
Dhan positions
+
Dhan funds
+
local intent ledger
```

---

# 20. You need an explicit "UNKNOWN" state

This is one of the most important rules in distributed trading.

Suppose:

```text
POST order
timeout
```

You do **not** know whether:

```text
order failed
```

or:

```text
order executed
```

Therefore:

```text
UNKNOWN
```

must be a valid order state.

Then:

```text
UNKNOWN
 ↓
query broker
 ↓
FOUND
   → FILLED / REJECTED / CANCELLED
```

or:

```text
NOT FOUND
 ↓
re-submit only if idempotency guarantees safety
```

Never:

```text
timeout
 ↓
retry
```

That can duplicate trades.

---

# 21. Startup sequence should be redesigned

Current boot already does several smart things, including starting risk/autonomy before reseeding existing positions.

But the correct startup protocol should be:

```text
BOOT
 │
 ├─ Validate configuration
 │
 ├─ Initialize durable store
 │
 ├─ Load last known state
 │
 ├─ Connect DhanHQ
 │
 ├─ Verify authentication
 │
 ├─ Start market data
 │
 ├─ Verify market feed health
 │
 ├─ Reconcile orders
 │
 ├─ Reconcile positions
 │
 ├─ Reconcile strategies
 │
 ├─ Rebuild monitors
 │
 ├─ Recalculate risk
 │
 ├─ Verify no invariant violations
 │
 └─ ENTER READY
```

Never:

# 22. Add a formal system state

You currently have pieces of this concept distributed around the services.

Create:

```typescript
type SystemState =
  | 'BOOTING'
  | 'CONNECTING'
  | 'SYNCING'
  | 'RECONCILING'
  | 'READY'
  | 'TRADING'
  | 'DEGRADED'
  | 'RECOVERING'
  | 'SAFE_MODE'
  | 'HALTED'
  | 'SHUTTING_DOWN';
```

Then define which operations are legal.

For example:

| State      | New Entries |          Exits | Reconcile |
| ---------- | ----------: | -------------: | --------: |
| BOOTING    |          No |             No |        No |
| SYNCING    |          No |           Yes* |       Yes |
| READY      |         Yes |            Yes |       Yes |
| DEGRADED   |  Restricted |            Yes |       Yes |
| RECOVERING |          No |            Yes |       Yes |
| SAFE_MODE  |          No |            Yes |       Yes |
| HALTED     |          No | Emergency only |       Yes |

This eliminates dozens of edge cases.

# 23. Market-data architecture needs per-instrument health

Current market data has:

```text
WS
REST
staleness
reconnect
extra subscriptions
```

which is good.

But currently the health model is still mostly feed-wide.

You need:

```text
InstrumentFeedState
```

for each:

```text
NIFTY
NIFTY 25000 CE
NIFTY 25000 PE
...
```

with:

```text
lastUpdate
source
age
sequence
expectedFrequency
gapCount
bidAge
askAge
ltpAge
```

Then:

```text
NIFTY index healthy
but
NIFTY 25000 CE stale
```

must be possible.

---

# 24. Do not use REST polling as a universal substitute for WS

Your fallback design is sensible for resilience.

But for safety-critical exits:

```text
WS dead
 ↓
REST every 3 seconds
```

means a fast move can happen during that interval.

The system should explicitly enter:

```text
EXIT_ONLY
```

when an instrument needed for open risk is stale beyond its policy.

For example:

```text
entry data stale → no new entries
exit data stale → emergency risk protocol
```

Not simply:

```text
continue with REST
```

---

# 25. Your trailing SL system needs portfolio/leg semantics

Current `PositionMonitor` tracking is position-based. The paper engine correctly re-arms from resulting net quantity rather than assuming the new order opened a flat position.

That's an improvement.

But with multi-leg strategies you need:

```text
LegStop
StrategyStop
PortfolioStop
```

Example:

```text
Iron Condor
 ├─ Short CE SL
 ├─ Short PE SL
 ├─ Wing hedge
 └─ Strategy max loss
```

Then:

```text
short CE hit SL
```

does **not automatically mean**

```text
close CE only
```

The adjustment engine needs to decide whether:

```text
close entire condor
OR
roll CE
OR
close opposite side
OR
convert structure
```

depending on the strategy policy.

---

# 26. Add adjustment strategies

A serious options engine should support:

```text
initial entry
      ↓
monitor
      ↓
adjust
      ↓
re-evaluate
      ↓
exit
```

Examples:

* roll threatened short strike
* roll untested side
* shift center
* convert condor
* convert straddle into strangle
* partial profit-taking
* delta hedge
* gamma hedge
* volatility-based adjustment

These should be **policy-driven deterministic actions**.

AI can recommend them.

AI should not execute uncontrolled adjustments.

---

# 27. Strategy risk should use payoff geometry

For every multi-leg position calculate:

```text
max profit
max loss
breakevens
probability of profit
delta exposure
gamma
theta
vega
margin
margin / max-loss ratio
```

And for every current market tick:

```text
current theoretical P&L curve
```

You should be able to render:

```text
P&L
 ^
 |             ______
 |            /      \
 |___________/        \____
 |
 +--------------------------------> Spot
```

with current spot highlighted.

That gives you a proper options trading terminal rather than merely a dashboard.

---

# 28. The frontend should be a projection, not another state system

Your frontend architecture is directionally right: REST snapshot + WS live stream, zero trading logic.

Keep that.

But add:

```text
Redux/Zustand query cache
        ↓
snapshot
        +
ordered events
        ↓
derived frontend state
```

Every WS event should have:

```text
eventId
sequence
timestamp
aggregateId
version
```

Then the frontend can detect:

```text
gap in event sequence
```

and request:

```text
GET snapshot
```

instead of silently drifting.

---

# 29. Frontend needs a proper trading-system cockpit

The dashboard should show:

### System

```text
SYSTEM: READY
MARKET DATA: HEALTHY
RISK: GREEN
AUTONOMY: ACTIVE
AGENT: IDLE
RECONCILIATION: CLEAN
```

### Portfolio

```text
Equity
Available margin
Used margin
Realized P&L
Unrealized P&L
Net delta
Gamma
Theta
Vega
```

### Positions

```text
Strategy
Leg
Qty
Avg
LTP
PnL
SL
Trail
Target
Greeks
```

### Execution

```text
Intent
Order
Status
Latency
Fill
Partial
Rejected
Unknown
```

### AI

```text
Market thesis
Candidate setups
Selected strategy
Risk decision
Execution decision
Critic
```

### Health

```text
WS latency
REST latency
tick age
event lag
DB latency
reconcile status
memory
CPU
```

---

# 30. You need incident timelines

When something breaks, the frontend must show:

```text
09:31:04.120
Signal generated

09:31:04.127
Risk approved

09:31:04.152
Order intent created

09:31:04.201
Order submitted

09:31:04.512
Partial fill 1/2

09:31:05.801
Broker WS disconnected

09:31:07.100
Order UNKNOWN

09:31:08.320
Reconciliation started

09:31:09.100
Fill discovered

09:31:09.200
State repaired
```

This will save you enormous debugging time.

---

# 31. Your database needs a stronger schema

Current tables are a good beginning:

```text
paper_wallet
paper_orders
paper_positions
paper_strategies
alerts
agent_events
risk_state
error_patterns
system_rules
```

The DB currently also serves as the durable paper ledger and warms an in-memory mirror.

I would evolve it toward:

```text
accounts
strategies
strategy_legs

order_intents
orders
order_events
fills

positions
position_lots

risk_snapshots
risk_events

market_snapshots

signals
opportunities

agent_runs
agent_steps
agent_decisions

reconciliation_runs
reconciliation_diffs

system_state
system_events

backtest_runs
backtest_trades
backtest_metrics
```

---

# 32. Position storage needs lot-level tracking

Current position aggregation:

```text
buy_qty
buy_avg
sell_qty
sell_avg
net_qty
```

works for a simple book.

But for complex strategy lifecycle, you eventually need:

```text
position_lot
```

Example:

```text
NIFTY 25000 CE

entry 1 → 50 @ 180
entry 2 → 50 @ 192
partial exit → 40 @ 220
```

You need exact attribution.

Otherwise:

```text
strategy P&L
leg P&L
trade P&L
tax/reporting P&L
```

can become ambiguous.

---

# 33. P&L attribution needs to become first-class

Every trade should carry:

```text
account
strategy
strategy_version
signal
agent_run
underlying
expiry
leg
entry
exit
fees
slippage
realized_pnl
```

Then you can answer:

```text
Which strategy makes money?
Which strategy fails during high IV?
Which agent decision caused losses?
Which underlying performs best?
Which expiry?
Which day/time?
Which regime?
```

Without this, "self-learning" is mostly theatre.

---

# 34. Agent memory is currently too weak to qualify as real learning

The agent stores events and recurring error patterns.

That's memory.

It is not learning.

You need an outcome loop:

```text
Decision
   ↓
Trade
   ↓
Result
   ↓
Attribution
   ↓
Regime
   ↓
Feature snapshot
   ↓
Decision quality
   ↓
Model/strategy statistics
```

For example:

```text
ORB + high IV + opening gap > 1%
→ historically poor
```

Then the system can update:

```text
strategy score
```

without rewriting its own source code.

---

# 35. Never allow self-learning to modify production trading code

I would explicitly forbid:

```text
LLM
 ↓
edit strategy code
 ↓
restart
 ↓
trade
```

That is an unacceptable control loop.

Instead:

```text
LLM
 ↓
propose policy
 ↓
policy validator
 ↓
simulation
 ↓
walk-forward
 ↓
approval threshold
 ↓
versioned strategy config
 ↓
canary paper
 ↓
production paper
```

---

# 36. Strategy versioning is mandatory

Every strategy deployment should have:

```text
strategy_id
version
parameters
entry rules
exit rules
risk rules
instrument selection
model version
feature version
```

Example:

```text
IRON_CONDOR
v17
```

Then every trade is attributable to the exact version.

---

# 37. Dhan instrument handling must become a first-class service

You currently depend on hardcoded fallback lot sizes such as:

```text
NIFTY 65
BANKNIFTY 30
SENSEX 20
```

with cache lookup logic.

That is a dangerous place for assumptions.

Build:

```text
InstrumentMaster
```

with:

```text
securityId
exchangeSegment
underlying
strike
optionType
expiry
lotSize
tickSize
tradingsymbol
instrumentType
activeFrom
activeTo
```

Then **never infer anything from the symbol string** when metadata exists.

Your current code already has parser-based symbol interpretation in multiple places.

That should become metadata-driven.

---

# 38. Expiry logic needs an explicit contract

The engine currently uses nearest expiry concepts.

A mature system needs:

```text
ExpirySelector
```

supporting:

```text
nearest weekly
nearest monthly
specific expiry
days-to-expiry
time-to-expiry
avoid expiry
expiry-day only
roll policy
```

And:

```text
holiday-aware trading calendar
```

rather than simple weekday logic.

---

# 39. Market hours should become exchange-calendar aware

The current IST clock is a good foundation and explicitly avoids host-timezone dependency.

But production correctness requires:

```text
holiday calendar
special sessions
exchange-specific sessions
expiry-day behavior
pre-open phases
auction periods
half-days
```

Also:

```text
NSE != BSE
```

should be reflected in the model rather than treating them as identical clock rules.

---

# 40. The "all possible scenarios" requirement requires fault injection

You should not try to reason manually about every failure.

Build a fault-injection harness.

Test:

```text
WS disconnect
WS half-open
WS duplicate tick
WS out-of-order tick
REST timeout
REST 429
REST 500
DB outage
DB timeout
DB partial transaction
Redis outage
LLM outage
LLM timeout
LLM malformed response
agent infinite loop
process SIGTERM
process SIGKILL
OOM
duplicate command
duplicate fill
partial fill
fill after timeout
order rejection
market gap
stale market
clock drift
instrument missing
expiry rollover
```

Then assert:

```text
system eventually reaches correct state
```

That should become your definition of reliability.

---

# 41. Build a deterministic invariant engine

Examples:

```text
INV-001:
net_qty = buy_qty - sell_qty

INV-002:
closed strategy cannot have open strategy legs

INV-003:
position P&L must reconcile to transaction history

INV-004:
filled_qty <= order_qty

INV-005:
filled orders must have at least one fill event

INV-006:
running strategy must have a valid strategy version

INV-007:
every live risk position must have a market-price source

INV-008:
kill switch prohibits new entry intents

INV-009:
no duplicate active intent for same idempotency key
```

Run invariants:

```text
on every transaction
on every reconciliation
on startup
before enabling trading
```

---

# 42. Introduce a Safety Supervisor above everything

This is the missing top-level architectural component.

I would make:

```text
                    SYSTEM SUPERVISOR
                          │
       ┌──────────────────┼───────────────────┐
       ▼                  ▼                   ▼

        └─────────────────┼───────────────────┘
                          ▼
                        Ledger
```

The supervisor decides:

```text
TRADE
PAUSE
EXIT_ONLY
SAFE_MODE
HALT
```

---

# 44. What I would change in your repository first

## Phase 1 — Make the kernel safe

**Priority: P0**

Build:

```text
TradingKernel
OrderStateMachine
StrategyStateMachine
ExecutionIntent
Idempotency
Durable events
Reconciliation
SystemSupervisor
```

This is more important than adding another 20 strategies.

---

## Phase 2 — Make paper execution realistic

**P0**

Replace:

```text
LTP + fixed tick
```

with:

```text
bid/ask/depth
partial fills
latency
spread
slippage model
order lifetime
cancel/replace
market gaps
```

---

## Phase 3 — Make multi-leg execution atomic-ish

**P0**

Add:

```text
StrategyOrder
LegOrder
Dependency graph
Leg sequencing
Partial strategy state
Repair engine
Emergency flatten
```

---

## Phase 4 — Reconciliation

**P0**

Every startup:

```text
load
compare
diff
repair
verify
READY
```

And periodic reconciliation during trading.

---

## Phase 5 — Backtest/live parity

**P1**

Refactor:

```text
MarketDataSource
Signal Engine
Risk Engine
Execution Model
Ledger
```

so live and historical simulations use the same strategy code.

---

## Phase 6 — Quant layer

**P1**

Add:

```text
real IV
Greeks
vol surface
skew
term structure
scenario engine
portfolio Greeks
payoff engine
```

---

## Phase 7 — Strategy DSL

**P1**

Make strategies composable rather than continuing to expand the TypeScript union.

---

## Phase 8 — Agentic AI

**P1**

Change:

```text
LLM → execute
```

into:

```text
LLM → TradeProposal
→ Validator
→ Risk
→ Execution planner
→ deterministic execution
```

---

## Phase 9 — Learning

**P2**

Add:

```text
decision attribution
trade outcomes
regime performance
strategy versioning
parameter optimization
walk-forward
canary deployment
```

---

# 45. What I would NOT build yet

I would **not** spend your next development cycle on:

```text
more agent personas
more frontend animations
more indicators
more strategy names
LLM self-modifying code
complex Redis topology
microservices
Kubernetes
```

None of those solve the core reliability problem.

The current architecture is already sufficiently service-oriented for a laptop deployment. The repository even deliberately supports PostgreSQL, Redis and Ollama as optional infrastructure.

For your current objective, **a disciplined modular monolith is better than premature microservices**.

# 46. Laptop deployment architecture

You can absolutely run this on a laptop.

I would use:

```text
Docker Compose
│
├── trading-core
├── postgres
├── redis
└── frontend
```

But operationally:

```text
trading-core
    │
    ├── DhanHQ REST
    ├── DhanHQ market WS
    ├── order WS
    ├── trading kernel
    ├── risk
    ├── recon
    ├── paper engine
    └── agent
```

Do **not** require the frontend or Ollama for the trading kernel to function.

Your existing architecture already embraces that principle, which is correct.

---

# 47. The reliability goal should be changed

Do not define the requirement as:

> "never fail."

That's impossible.

Define it as:

> **No single component failure may permanently corrupt the trading ledger or leave the system unknowingly out of sync.**

And:

> **Every uncertain state eventually transitions to a known state or a safe state.**

That is the real architectural requirement.

The fundamental property becomes:

```text
FAILURE
   ↓
DETECT
   ↓
ISOLATE
   ↓
RECOVER
   ↓
RECONCILE
   ↓
VERIFY
   ↓
RESUME
```

or:

```text
FAILURE
   ↓
SAFE MODE
```

but never:

```text
FAILURE
   ↓
UNKNOWN
   ↓
keep trading
```

---

# 48. Overall conclusion

Your current repository is **much further along than a normal paper-trading prototype**.

The architecture already contains several genuinely good decisions:

* backend autonomy
* risk-gated order paths
* DhanHQ WS/REST fallback
* persistent paper ledger
* realtime event stream
* multi-leg strategy construction
* trailing SL/TP
* agent telemetry
* deterministic fallback behavior
* explicit live-mode safety refusal
* restart re-seeding

Those are real strengths.

But the system currently lacks the property that separates an **advanced trading application** from a **robust trading engine**:

> **Deterministic state convergence after partial failure.**

That is where I would concentrate the next major engineering effort.

The most important change is therefore not "add more strategies." It is:

```text
                 CURRENT
Signal
  ↓
Agent
  ↓
Risk
  ↓
Execution
  ↓
Position


                 TARGET
Market
  ↓
Opportunity
  ↓
Signal
  ↓
Agent → Proposal
  ↓
Strategy Validator
  ↓
Portfolio Risk
  ↓
Execution Planner
  ↓
Durable Intent
  ↓
Order State Machine
  ↓
Execution
  ↓
Durable Events
  ↓
Position Ledger
  ↓
Reconciliation
  ↓
Supervisor
```

Once that kernel is correct, **NIFTY / BANKNIFTY / SENSEX, CE/PE buy/sell, spreads, condors, straddles, strangles, ratio structures, trailing systems, autonomous AI, realtime UI, and backtesting all become consumers of the same reliable infrastructure rather than separate pieces of trading logic.**

One particularly important point: the repository itself currently blocks `TRADING_MODE=live` because the risk/autonomy/kill-switch state is still tied to the paper book rather than a real broker portfolio source. That is exactly the right safety decision today; the next architectural milestone should be building the generalized `PortfolioSource + ReconciliationEngine` abstraction before live execution is ever enabled.

Yes. **The Node backend is doing too much inside one OS process**, and your `algo_scalper_api` architecture provides a very good model for fixing that.

The important part is not simply "make more processes." It is to separate **latency-sensitive trading work**, **control/API work**, and **slow/background AI/analytics work** so one failure or CPU spike cannot interfere with the trading kernel.

Your Rails system already does this explicitly:

```text
web       → Rails API
trading   → long-running trading daemon
jobs      → background worker
dashboard → frontend
```

and the web and trading processes communicate through shared PostgreSQL/Redis rather than in-process objects.

Its `TradingDaemon` is explicitly designed so the trading runtime can be restarted independently of Puma, with a supervisor managing service lifecycle and health checks.

## What is overloaded in `dhanhq-node`

Right now `startCore()` brings essentially everything into one Node process:

```text
HTTP / WS API
      +
Dhan market WS
      +
Dhan order WS
      +
market-data processing
      +
risk engine
      +
autonomy loop
      +
strategy construction
      +
agentic AI
      +
backtesting
      +
self-healing
      +
Telegram
      +
Postgres
      +
Redis
```

The architecture document describes exactly this shared `startCore()` arrangement.

That is manageable for development.

For an autonomous trading engine, it creates unnecessary failure coupling.

# The split I recommend

Do **not** turn every service into a microservice.

Instead use **4 logical processes**.

This is the architecture I would use.

---

# 1. Process 1 — `trading`

This should be the **sacred process**.

It owns anything that can affect open risk.

### Keep here

```text
MarketDataService
Dhan market WebSocket
Dhan order-update WebSocket

TradingKernel
  ├─ OpportunityEngine
  ├─ SignalEngine
  ├─ StrategyEngine
  ├─ PortfolioRiskEngine
  ├─ OrderManager
  ├─ ExecutionPlanner
  ├─ PaperExecutionEngine
  ├─ PositionManager
  ├─ ExitEngine
  ├─ TrailingEngine
  ├─ ReconciliationEngine
  └─ TradingSupervisor
```

This process should have a very strict rule:

> **No slow AI work, no HTTP request processing, no heavy backtesting, no expensive analytics.**

The Rails architecture gives us essentially the same principle: its `trading` process owns the long-running trading services independently from `web`.

---

# 2. Process 2 — `web`

This should be extremely thin.

```text
web
 ├─ REST API
 ├─ WebSocket gateway
 ├─ dashboard snapshots
 ├─ configuration
 ├─ operator commands
 └─ authentication
```

It does **not** execute trades directly.

Instead:

```text
POST /orders
      ↓
Command Store / Redis
      ↓
Trading Process
      ↓
Order State Machine
```

And the response becomes:

```text
command_id = cmd_123
status = ACCEPTED
```

rather than pretending the HTTP process performed the trade.

That makes frontend failure irrelevant to trading.

---

# 3. Process 3 — `ai-worker`

This is where I would move the current `AgentOrchestrator`.

Your current agent contains:

```text
planner
analyst
strategy
risk
execution
critic
```

plus Ollama calls and strategy/backtest reasoning.

That is exactly the workload that should **not** share a process with the market-feed/order-monitoring loop.

Imagine:

```text
09:27:30

Ollama hangs for 15 seconds
```

Today:

```text
trading process
   ↓
agent call
   ↓
event loop affected
```

Target:

```text
trading process
   │
   ├──── emits Opportunity
   │
   └──── continues trading

ai-worker
   ↓
analyse
   ↓
TradeProposal
```

The trading process then decides whether that proposal is even eligible.

---

# 4. AI should become a producer of proposals

This is the key architectural change.

Instead of:

```text
Agent
  ↓
executeStrategy()
  ↓
placeOrder()
```

use:

```text
Trading Process
      ↓
Opportunity
      ↓
AI Worker
      ↓
TradeProposal
      ↓
Trading Process
      ↓
Strategy Validator
      ↓
Risk
      ↓
Order State Machine
```

The AI therefore becomes **advisory**, while the trading kernel remains authoritative.

That eliminates the most dangerous failure mode of an LLM process.

---

# 5. Process 4 — `jobs`

This is where your current backtesting and maintenance workloads belong.

You already have a substantial historical backtest pipeline. The repository uses DhanHQ historical data and evaluates a strategy universe from cached or fetched sessions.

Move that out of the trading process.

Examples:

```text
backtest worker
historical option data import
instrument-master refresh
strategy optimization
walk-forward tests
Monte Carlo analysis
daily reports
trade attribution
learning statistics
database maintenance
```

A backtest should never be able to starve the trading event loop.

---

# 6. What I would NOT move out of the trading process

Do not move these merely for "clean architecture":

```text
RiskEngine
PositionManager
ExitEngine
TrailingEngine
OrderStateMachine
ReconciliationEngine
MarketData
ExecutionEngine
```

These belong together because they form one **transactional risk domain**.

For example:

```text
tick
 ↓
position update
 ↓
SL/trail check
 ↓
risk decision
 ↓
exit intent
 ↓
execution
```

You want this path extremely short.

Splitting these across processes creates:

```text
network latency
message ordering
duplicate processing
distributed locking
eventual consistency
```

which is exactly what you are trying to avoid.

---

# 7. The trading process should itself have internal services

This is where `algo_scalper_api` is a very good reference.

Its `Bootstrap` builds a supervisor containing multiple trading services rather than making each one an OS process.

Do the same.

```text
trading process
      │
      ▼
TradingSupervisor
      │
      ├── market-feed
      ├── order-feed
      ├── opportunity-engine
      ├── signal-engine
      ├── strategy-engine
      ├── risk-engine
      ├── position-manager
      ├── exit-engine
      ├── order-manager
      ├── reconciliation
      └── health-monitor
```

Then each service implements:

```typescript
interface TradingService {
  start(): Promise<void>;
  stop(): Promise<void>;
  healthy(): boolean;
}
```

And the supervisor does exactly what your Rails supervisor already does:

```text
start_all
stop_all
restart_service
health_check
```

Your Rails `Supervisor` already implements those lifecycle operations.

---

# 8. Important distinction: process isolation vs service isolation

You do **not** want this:

```text
10 services
=
10 processes
```

You want:

```text
4 processes
+
many internal services
```

### Recommended

| Process   | Main responsibility                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `trading` | deterministic real-time trading kernel |
| `web`     | REST + realtime dashboard              |
| `ai`      | Ollama / agentic reasoning             |
| `jobs`    | backtest + analytics + maintenance     |

That's enough.

---

# 9. Redis becomes the process boundary

Your existing architecture already has Redis as an optional bridge.

For the redesigned system I would make Redis a **real command/event transport**, not merely a compatibility feature.

Example:

```text
trading.commands
trading.events
trading.opportunities
ai.requests
ai.proposals
jobs.commands
system.health
```

But **PostgreSQL remains the durable source of truth**.

Redis is transport/cache.

---

# 10. PostgreSQL becomes the cross-process contract

For example:

```text
trade_intents
orders
order_events
fills
positions
strategies
strategy_versions
risk_snapshots
opportunities
agent_runs
agent_proposals
reconciliation_runs
system_events
backtest_runs
```

Then:

```text
web
  ↓
command

trading
  ↓
durable order state

ai
  ↓
proposal

trading
  ↓
validation

jobs
  ↓
analysis
```

No process needs access to another process's memory.

That is exactly the advantage your Rails system gets from keeping web and trading as separate OS processes.

---

# 11. The supervisor should be promoted to a first-class component

Your current Node system has a bootstrap but doesn't yet have the same explicit process/service supervisor pattern as `algo_scalper_api`.

I would introduce:

```text
src/runtime/
    supervisor.ts
    process.ts
    health.ts
    lifecycle.ts
```

Then:

```text
trading
   ↓
TradingSupervisor
```

The supervisor handles:

```text
startup order
health
restart
shutdown
dependency checks
safe mode
recovery
```

---

# 12. The process topology should eventually look like your Rails system

Your existing Rails setup is essentially:

```text
./bin/dev
    │
    ├── web
    ├── trading
    ├── jobs
    └── dashboard
```

For Node:

```text
npm run dev
    │
    ├── web
    ├── trading
    ├── ai
    ├── jobs
    └── frontend
```

Production:

```text
docker compose

trading
web
ai
jobs
postgres
redis
frontend
```

---

# 13. Failure behavior becomes much better

### Ollama crashes

```text
ai-worker dies
       ↓
trading continues
       ↓
existing strategies still monitored
       ↓
new AI-driven opportunities disabled/degraded
```

Excellent.

### Frontend crashes

```text
web/frontend dies
       ↓
trading continues
```

### Backtest consumes 100% CPU

```text
jobs worker overloaded
       ↓
trading unaffected
```

### Trading process crashes

```text
supervisor / Docker
       ↓
restart trading
       ↓
reconcile
       ↓
rebuild subscriptions
       ↓
rebuild monitors
       ↓
verify risk
       ↓
READY
```

This is the behavior you actually want.

---

# 14. There is one thing I would take directly from `algo_scalper_api`

Its daemon explicitly performs reconciliation during startup before normal trading services begin.

That should become a hard rule in Node:

```text
TRADING PROCESS START
       ↓
connect infrastructure
       ↓
connect DhanHQ
       ↓
reconcile
       ↓
verify invariants
       ↓
start market feed
       ↓
start trading services
       ↓
READY
```

Not:

```text
start everything
then figure out state
```

---

# 15. I would also improve on the Rails design

There is one thing I would **not** copy literally.

The Rails daemon currently has 11 services as threads inside one process.

For our Node architecture, that's fine for most deterministic trading services, but I would isolate the AI and heavy jobs as separate processes because they are qualitatively different workloads.

So:

```text
Rails-inspired
+
Node-specific AI isolation
```

is better than a direct clone.

---

## My recommendation

**Yes — extract the backend into separate OS processes.**

But I would **not** split the trading kernel itself apart.

The right boundary is:

> **Trading = one deterministic, low-latency process.
> Web = one control-plane process.
> AI = one isolated reasoning process.
> Jobs = one slow/background process.**

That gives you essentially the `algo_scalper_api` operational model, but with a stronger separation between **deterministic trading** and **non-deterministic agentic AI**. The Rails system already demonstrates the value of separating the API process from the long-running trading daemon, including independent lifecycle and health management.

**I would make this process split before adding more strategies or expanding the agent.** It will make everything else—reconciliation, recovery, realtime frontend, AI, and eventually live execution—substantially easier to make correct.
