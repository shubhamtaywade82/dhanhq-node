/**
 * Append-only durable record of the decisions this system makes — the
 * thing to read after a crash or an unexpected outcome, distinct from
 * Postgres (current position/wallet state) and from stdout logs (verbose,
 * not queryable by kind, rotated away by the host).
 *
 * Scope: a durable, queryable AUDIT TRAIL — order intents and their
 * results, risk decisions (breaker trips, kill/disarm), EOD/square-off
 * events, and every control-plane command an operator issues. NOT tick
 * data (a separate, much higher-volume concern with its own tradeoffs).
 *
 * summarizeDay() (below) reads today's entries back on boot for a
 * CROSS-CHECK against Postgres/mem (core.ts) — verifying every journaled
 * trade has a matching durable order record, and that the journal's last
 * kill-switch action agrees with the risk engine's current state — not a
 * full event-sourced reconstruction. The journal never writes state back;
 * a mismatch is surfaced loudly (log + alert), never silently "fixed" from
 * the journal, because the journal only covers what happened THIS trading
 * day and can't tell a legitimate multi-day carry-over position from
 * actual drift.
 *
 * One file per IST trading day (JOURNAL_DIR/YYYY-MM-DD.ndjson), so a day's
 * journal is a bounded, easy-to-ship artifact and old days can be archived
 * or deleted independently. A monotonic per-process `seq` orders entries
 * unambiguously even when two land in the same millisecond.
